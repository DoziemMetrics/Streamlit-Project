# Diabetes Prediction App

This is a simple web application built using Streamlit for predicting diabetes based on input variables. The app utilizes a machine learning model trained on a diabetes prediction dataset.

The app allows users to input various parameters such as age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. Upon clicking the "Predict" button, the model provides a prediction of whether the individual is diabetic or non-diabetic.

## Live App

You can access the live app [here](https://doziemmetrics-streamlit-project-main-tk5p4k.streamlit.app/). Feel free to try it out and see the predictions for yourself.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation on how the model was built and the process of diabetes diagnosis and predictive modeling can be found in the [Diabetes-Diagnosis-and-Predictive-Modeling](https://github.com/DoziemMetrics/Diabetes-Diagnosis-and-Predictive-Modeling) repository.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Acknowledgement
I would like to thank Mr. Durojaye Olusegun for pointing out that i could do this deployment myself. The app was built as a personal project due to my family's history of diabetes, with the aim of raising awareness and promoting early detection.
